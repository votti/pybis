# Discussion

We discussed the proposal for extending openBIS to support use cases for analyzing large data sets. The starting point for the discussion was RR's document https://wiki.systemsx.ch/display/DLCM/DLCM+-+WP2.4b+Data+management+of+large+and+distributed+data+sets+for+Data+Science.

Key points we touched on were the commands that would need to be supported and their basic semantics along with changes necessary to openBIS to support them.

We enumerated the following commands that we would need:

| Command       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| obis register | Register unmanaged data set with openBIS |
| obis cp       | Copy data to new location and register copy with openBIS |
| obis mv       | Update location of data in openBIS |
| obis fsck     | Check for discrepancies between local state and openBIS expected state |

To support these changes, we came up with the following changes that would need to be made to openBIS:

- Introduce a new data set type -- unmanaged
- Introduce a new concept on data sets: copies. A data set can have multiple copies.
- Copies need to support the concept of being "altered". A copy can be changed with respect to the original source.

RR, SW, and CR discussed the needs in greater detail and came with a proposal. This proposal is located at https://sissource.ethz.ch/sis/pybis/blob/master/docs/roadmap/bigdata-usecases.md.
